High on your eyes
Sleepings so far
A million stars
Melt in the dark
The branches of dreams
The soda machines all
Will burn up the fire
When your rip out my heart
So kiss me, kiss me, kiss me dead
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me dead
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me dead

Up in the sky
And out f the blue
The look on your face
Is totally cool
The braches of dreams
See how they break
And rip the apart
That's the mess
That you make
When you
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me dead
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me dead
Well I say
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me dead

Is it anything
Or is it everything
Is it anything

High on your eyes
Sleepings so far
A million stars
Melt in the dark
The branches of dreams
The soda machines all
Will burn up the fire
When your rip out my heart
So kiss me, kiss me, kiss me dead
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me dead
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me dead
