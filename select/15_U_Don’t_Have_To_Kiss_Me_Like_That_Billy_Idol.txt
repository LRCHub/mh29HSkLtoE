Bet you didn't think this was part of the plan
An empty parking lot at 2 AM
Leaning on my bumper, not a single soul in sight
Yeah

The one that got away, now the one of my dreams
Tryin' to make a move, bustin' at the seams
I could be your king if you let me crown you tonight

You keep acting like you gotta go
Without a chance for me to show
Put your arms around me
Let me be your savior tonight

One touch of your lips
Sent electric shock to my hips
It's the first round, I'm coming unzipped
Don't put up a fight

You ain't gotta kiss me like that
Do it just so good that I can't react
Your mouth is gonna give me a heart attack
When it hits mine

You don't have to leave me tonight
Stay a little longer, honey, I won't bite
Not at least until the moment is right
I hope that's fine

You ain't gotta kiss me like that
But if you do it's alright, alright, alright
It's alright, alright, alright

All I did was take time runnin' around
Chasin' all the taken ones, fightin' off a town
If you were around, I would have tried a little harder back then
Yeah

Glad your baby daddy brought you out tonight
Too bad the cops took him in for a fight
We gotta lot of time to become a little more than friends

So don't act like you gotta go
Without a chance for me to show
Let me be your Jesus
You can be my Mary tonight

You ain't gotta kiss me like that
Do it just so good that I can't react
Your mouth is gonna give me a heart attack
When it hits mine

You don't have to leave me tonight
Stay a little longer, honey, I won't bite
Not at least until the moment is right
I hope that's fine

You ain't gotta kiss me like that
But if you do it's alright, alright, alright
It's alright, alright, alright

I'm a sayin', come over here now
(I come a runnin', ooh, I come a runnin')
Oh girl, come a little closer now
(I come a runnin', ooh, I come a runnin', babe)
Oh, feel me all over now
(I come a runnin', ooh, I come a runnin', babe)

You ain't gotta kiss me like that
Do it just so good that I can't react
Your mouth is gonna give me a heart attack
When it hits mine

You don't have to leave me tonight
Stay a little longer, honey, I won't bite, yeah
Not at least until the moment is right
I hope that's fine

You ain't gotta kiss me like that
But if you do it's alright, alright, alright
It's alright, alright, alright
It's alright, alright, alright
It's alright, alright, alright
