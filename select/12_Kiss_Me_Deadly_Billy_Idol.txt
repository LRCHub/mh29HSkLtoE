The Greyhound's rocking out tonight
To maximum rockabilly
When two punks choose to risk the subway
For a tube to Picadilly
The Zephrys stir fast gangs for glory
Another dumb casualty

I'm having fun
In South West Six
A hidden flick knife flicks
Oh, kiss me, kiss me deadly tonight

Another battle was won and lost
Down The Bishops End last night
And a spotlight, it hit the kids in triumph
With a thousand scarves in flight, see how they run
I said we run from the terraces in black and white
Young and old into the fight

We're having fun
In South West Six
With violence for a fix
Oh, kiss me, kiss me deadly tonight

Seven o'clock, we stand in rank
For the thirty bus uptown
And later in a downstairs room
She pulls her lover down
In ecstacy, but they can't make a sound
In case her mother might come down

I'm having fun
In South West Six
Violence for a fix
Oh, kiss me, kiss me deadly tonight

The Snooker Halls, they are empty
'Cause we're all out playing pool
Yes, hustling down the Fulham Road
Doing deals with Mr.Cool
Yeah, we're all out on the waterfront now instead of being at school
Too old now, even to dig pinball

I'm having fun
In South West Six
I'm having fun
With a hidden flick knife flicks
With violence for a fix
I discovered teenage sex
I tried shooting up for

I said kiss me
Kiss me deadly
I said kiss me
Kiss me, deadly
I said kiss me
I said deadly
Kiss me
Kiss me tonight
